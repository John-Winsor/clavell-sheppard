This is a tribute website to the late Clavell Sheppard.
Clavell Sheppard was born in England in 1906.  In 1909 he emigrated to North America aged 3 with his family.  The family settled in Alberta, Canada.
At the age of 21 Clavell was resident in San Quentin, California for the crime of fraud.  He had written a bad cheque for $35 (worth about $600 in today's money).
Eventually he returned to live in England.  Clavell married at least six women.  One in Canada and the rest in the UK.  But he was never divorced.
Clavell fathered a large number of children.  Nobody knows how many.  Surely today he would have an exponentially large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Apart from any crimes commited in the U.S.A. or Canada, it is known that he had a criminal record in the UK comprising six entries.
Also he commited at least one serious crime (robbery of a postman) in the UK for which he was never caught.
Clavell Sheppard died in 1983 aged 77 years.  All his working life he lived from the social benefits ("Welfare" payments) of his wives.
The moral of this story is that there is "Survival Value" in being born a psychopath.
