In a far away galaxy there is surely a planet where creatures have evolved with eyes disposed vertically.  So one eye is above the other.  Such creatures should be avid consumers of smartphones where the favourite mode of use is with the screen in "portrait" mode.

Here on Earth our own smartphones and tablet PCs have the intrinsic option of "landscape" mode, depending upon their orientation.  But is that option reasonable for accommodation by website designers?

I would argue that "landscape" mode is the most natural for Earthlings and this needs to be universally synchronised between the designers and viewers of websites.  Why should designers go to enormous trouble to provide a "portrait" presentation where "landscape" is obviously superior in most cases?

In designing this website, which is otherwise unexceptional, I have attempted to apply this principle.  When viewed with a smartphone held vertically the viewer is presented with a polite request to hold it horizontally.  And that is all that should be necessary.

I reckon that smartphone screens are an example of pure anarchy.  Among the various manufacturers, and among their various models, one can find an enormous disparity in screen aspect ratios and in pixel resolutions.
